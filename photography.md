# Photography

I occasionally take photos of things that I find beautiful or interesting. 

## Gear

My EDC for photography is an iPhone Xs, the regular kind. I find that this phone takes pictures that are plenty good enough for making memories and it's ideal for taking on traveling trips where I need to pack light and travel fast. I used my iPhone as my primary and only camera for my first backpacking trip on the Lost Coast
