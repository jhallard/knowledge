# Task Management

Todoist - I use the todoist application as my primary task management \(i.e. todo-list management\). I try to  use Todoist in a [Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) capacity, though I often fail to stick to schedule. 

### Overdue Tasks

One of my primary flaws with Todoist and the thing I need to improve the most on is ensuring that I properly reschedule tasks after they pass their due date. As I let tasks build up I get discouraged and use the application less and less often, leading to more backup and continuing a downward spiral. Eventually I'll find some motivation to reschedule tasks but this doesn't last for long.

## Stale Tasks

What to do with stale tasks? Let's say I had a reference to a support ticket that nobody has followed up on but contains some important information that I don't want to delete. What to do in this case? I could possibly give it a new label like "stale" and let those be grouped into a specific class that is out of the way of all of my other tasks.
