# Bookmarks

## Quickly Saving Content

I've found [Aurora](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aurora-new-tab-bookmark-m/mjmipbogglnbgcabealdgbfdkpochcjg?hl=en) to be the best bookmark manager and start-page for Chrome. Some other start pages for Chrome are built on top of their own proprietary bookmarking systems, saving your bookmarks in their own databases and making it impossible to export the data or manage it in a way that you want. Aurora is simply a markup over your own Chrome bookmarks and it is open source. The Aurora start page simply displays the bookmarks that you have in Chrome in a clean and accessible fashion.

As I fill out this wiki I expect to rely on Aurora and the Chrome bookmarks less and less, though I suspect they will serve a more pure and useful purpose of indexing links that I need to access quick and often rather than using it as a place to store links to every cool blog / paper / link that I've come across on the internet.
