# Personal Wiki / Knowledge Base

## Welcome

I'm [John Allard](https://jhallard.com), and this is my [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) that serves as a publicly available wiki and personal knowledge base of mine. 

> Lapsus Memoriae - _a slip of the mind_

I have a less than stellar memory but I also like to learn things. Combining these facts led me to the conclusion that I need some way of writing things downs and indexing the things that I want to remember.

I came across [this beautiful gitbook](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) from the amazing [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/) and it inspired me to make something similar for myself.

## My Website

My primary website can be found at [https://jhallard.com](https://jhallard.com). This website serves as the home base that links out to some more interesting components

* [My Blog](https://blog.jhallard.com) \(_in development_\) - _slightly_ more structured writings of mine than what you find here
* [Photo Gallery](https://photos.jhallard.com) \(_in development_\) - full-resolution gallery of photos that I've taken, possibly organized into albums.
* [API](https://api.jhallard.com) \(_in development_\) - My personal API. Used to manage certain aspects of my life, more of an exercise in programming than anything practical.

## Getting Started

The wiki is ordered by category on the right-hand side. Underneath each category is a high-level topic that leads to the main page for that topic. Subtopics are grouped underneath there.
